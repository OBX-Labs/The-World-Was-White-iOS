Three friends. A silent winter day. A long drive together, in the midst of going our separate ways. Trying to figure it all out.

The World Was White is a homage to the many, many road trips—short and long—I took across northern California with friends while a teenager. 

Much later, I have come to realize that it is also about growing up one of the few brown kids in white, rural mountain country.
